# Basic Logic -

> 1. Game Begins with Lives == 3, Score == 0
> 2. On Click, Rocks Generated at Random, Ship Spawned in the middle.
> 3. If, Ship & Rock Collide -> Lives -= 1 (line 304)
> 4. If Ship's Missiles collide with Rock -> score += hits*10 (line 311)
> 5. When Lives == 0, End Screen Appears.
> 6. Game can be restarted by clicking again.
